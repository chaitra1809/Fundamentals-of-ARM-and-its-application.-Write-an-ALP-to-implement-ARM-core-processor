The RISC architecture, a widely used computer arrangement, is the foundation of the ARM, 
which is an acronym for Advanced RISC Machine. It is a 32-bit module that was developed in 
1987 by Acron. This board is made by ST Microelectronics and Motorola, two separate MCU 
manufacturers. This module is divided into various categories, such as ARMv1 and ARMv2, 
and each category offers a unique set of features. An ARM core is functional units connected 
by data buses. where, the arrows represent the flow of data, the lines represent the buses, and 
the boxes represent either an operation unit or a storage area. The attached figure in report shows not only the flow of data but also the abstract components that make up an ARM core.
